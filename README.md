# Dynamic Javascript Quiz Week-4 Challenge

## Description

My motivation for creating this dynamic Javascript quiz was to practice Dom manipulation and Web API properties. 
Furthermore, it can also be a good practice quiz to prepare for job interviews. While creating this quiz, I learned 
about grabbing selectors and creating references using javascript, hoisting, scope, functions, adding and removing classes using javascript, using local storage, creating setIntervals, events, array properties and methods, event listeners, if else statements, and data validation.
